./scripts/team/manage_team_access.sh start-team

# Stop all environments
./scripts/team/manage_team_access.sh stop-all

# Check environment status
./scripts/team/manage_team_access.sh status
```

### Member Management
```bash
# Add team members
./scripts/team/manage_team_access.sh add-member "Alice Johnson" analyst
./scripts/team/manage_team_access.sh add-member "Bob Wilson" developer
./scripts/team/manage_team_access.sh add-member "Carol Davis" researcher

## Shared Resources

### Database Access
All team members share the same PostgreSQL database with role-based permissions:

- **Analysts**: Read-only access to all tables
- **Developers**: Full read/write access
- **Researchers**: Read-only access with research-specific views

### Jupyter Notebooks
Shared notebook environment with:
- **Common Notebooks**: Shared analysis templates
- **Personal Workspaces**: Individual member directories
- **Collaborative Notebooks**: Team analysis projects

### Data Storage
Organized data access:
- **Raw Data**: Read-only for analysts and researchers
- **Processed Data**: Shared analysis results
- **Reports**: Collaborative report generation

## Collaboration Workflow

### Git Workflow
```bash
# 1. Always start from main
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# 2. Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# 3. Make changes and commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: description of changes"

# 4. Push and create pull request
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
# Create PR on GitHub
```

### Code Review Process
1. **Create Pull Request**: Detailed description and testing notes
2. **Automated Checks**: CI/CD pipeline validation
3. **Peer Review**: At least one team member review
4. **Testing**: Verify changes don't break existing functionality
5. **Merge**: Approved changes merged to main branch

### Communication Channels
- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: General project discussions
- **Pull Request Reviews**: Code-specific discussions
- **Team Meetings**: Regular sync meetings

## Security and Best Practices

### API Key Management
```bash
# Each team member manages their own API keys
cp config/api_keys_template.yaml config/api_keys.yaml
# Edit with your personal API keys
# Never commit this file to version control
```

### Data Security
- **Database Backups**: Automated daily backups
- **Access Logging**: All database access logged
- **Role-Based Access**: Minimum necessary permissions
- **Secure Configuration**: Sensitive data excluded from version control

### Development Standards
- **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 for Python
- **Documentation**: Comment complex functions
- **Testing**: Write tests for new features
- **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commit format
