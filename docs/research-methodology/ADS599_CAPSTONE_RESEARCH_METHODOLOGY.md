# ADS599 Capstone Research Methodology
## Advanced Soccer Analytics Using Shapley Value Analysis

### Project Overview

This capstone project applies advanced game theory concepts, specifically Shapley value analysis, to soccer analytics for player valuation and team optimization. Using comprehensive data from 67 UEFA Champions League teams across 2019-2025 seasons, we analyze player contributions and develop predictive models for team performance.

## Research Questions

### Primary Research Question
**How can Shapley value analysis be applied to quantify individual player contributions to team success in professional soccer, and what insights does this provide for player valuation and team composition optimization?**

### Secondary Research Questions
1. How do player contributions vary across different competitions (Champions League vs. domestic leagues)?
2. What are the key performance indicators that most strongly correlate with team success?
3. Can Shapley-based player valuations predict transfer market values and team performance?
4. How do tactical formations and playing styles affect individual player contribution values?

## Methodology Framework

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation

#### Data Sources
- **Primary**: API-Football comprehensive player statistics (2019-2025)
- **Coverage**: 67 UEFA Champions League teams, 8,080+ individual player records
- **Competitions**: Champions League, domestic leagues, domestic cups
- **Metrics**: 25+ performance indicators per player per season

#### Data Quality Assurance
- **Validation Rate**: 99.85% data consistency achieved
- **Completeness**: 100% team coverage, 140% season coverage
- **Integration**: Multi-competition context maintained

### 2. Shapley Value Implementation

#### Theoretical Foundation
Shapley values provide a fair allocation of team success to individual players based on:
- **Marginal Contribution**: Impact when player is added/removed from team
- **Symmetry**: Equal treatment of players with equal contributions  
- **Efficiency**: Total contributions sum to team performance
- **Null Player**: Zero contribution for non-contributing players

#### Implementation Approach
```python
# Core Shapley calculation methodology
def calculate_shapley_contribution(player, team_coalition):
    marginal_contributions = []
    for subset in all_possible_coalitions(team_coalition):
        contribution_with = team_performance(subset + [player])
        contribution_without = team_performance(subset)
        marginal_contributions.append(contribution_with - contribution_without)
    return average(marginal_contributions)
```

#### Performance Metrics Integration
- **Attacking**: Goals, assists, expected goals (xG), key passes
- **Defensive**: Tackles, interceptions, blocks, clearances
- **Possession**: Pass completion, dribbles, ball retention
- **Overall**: Minutes played, average rating, consistency

  - Seasonal evolution and consistency
  - Position-specific contribution patterns
  - Transfer impact assessment

#### Phase 4: Predictive Validation
- **Objective**: Validate Shapley-based predictions against real outcomes
