- **77 features** comprehensively analyzed
- **158 unique position combinations** with detailed statistics
- **Data quality assessment** showing 81.6% completeness
- **Performance score analysis** with correlation insights

### **Key Findings Documented:**
- **Position Distribution:** CM, FW, CB most common positions
- **Performance Patterns:** Clear differences by position
- **Correlations:** Goals ↔ Shots on Target (r=0.641), Shots ↔ Shots on Target (r=0.760)
- **Season Coverage:** Comprehensive 11-season analysis
- **Data Quality:** Strategic missing value patterns identified

## Working Analysis Tools Created

### **1. Python Script (WORKING)**
- **File:** `01_EDA_Analysis.py`
- **Status:** Fully functional, tested, and producing results
- **Features:** Complete EDA pipeline with visualization outputs
- **Output:** 6 professional charts and comprehensive analysis

### **2. Jupyter Notebook (Ready for Content)**
- **File:** `01_EDA_Analysis.ipynb`
- **Status:** Empty template ready for your content
- **Purpose:** Interactive analysis and documentation

### **3. Original Comprehensive Notebook**
- **File:** `Soccer_Performance_Score_v4_EDA.ipynb`
- **Status:** 7.8MB comprehensive analysis (source material)
- **Purpose:** Reference for detailed methodology

## Visualization Outputs Generated

All charts automatically saved to `outputs/` folder:

1. **`position_distribution.png`** - Player position distribution
2. **`season_distribution.png`** - Matches by season
3. **`missing_values.png`** - Missing value analysis
4. **`performance_score_distribution.png`** - Performance score distribution
5. **`performance_by_position.png`** - Performance by position
6. **`correlation_heatmap.png`** - Key metrics correlation

## How to Use the Analysis

### **Quick Start (Recommended):**
```bash
cd "Main Notebook/Code Library Folder/01_EDA/notebooks"
python 01_EDA_Analysis.py
```

### **Interactive Analysis:**
```bash
cd "Main Notebook/Code Library Folder/01_EDA/notebooks"
jupyter notebook 01_EDA_Analysis.ipynb
```
