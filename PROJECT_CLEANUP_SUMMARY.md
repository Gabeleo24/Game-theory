## What Was Removed (Redundant/Temporary)

### **Redundant Data (Safe to Remove)**
- **data/processed/** - Duplicate of focused data in different format
- **data/raw/** - Temporary cache files
- **data/cache/** - Temporary cached API responses

### **Temporary Files (Safe to Remove)**
- Python cache files (`__pycache__`, `*.pyc`)
- Temporary files (`*.tmp`, `*.temp`, `*.bak`)
- System files (`.DS_Store`, `Thumbs.db`)
- Old collection logs (older than current session)

### **Old Logs (Safe to Remove)**
- **logs/player_collection/** - Old data collection session logs
- Old SQL logs (kept recent ones)

## Current Project Status

### **Database Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL**
```
Table                | Records
--------------------|--------
player_statistics   | 8,080
players             | 3,980
matches             | 98
teams               | 67
```
