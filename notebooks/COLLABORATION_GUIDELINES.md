# Jupyter Notebook Collaboration Guidelines
ADS599 Capstone Soccer Intelligence System

## Notebook Organization

### Directory Structure
- `shared/` - Notebooks accessible to all team members
- `personal/` - Individual workspaces (role-specific)
- `research/` - Academic research and methodology
- `archive/` - Completed and deprecated notebooks

### Naming Convention
Format: `{date}_{author}_{purpose}_{version}.ipynb`

Examples:
- `2024-07-07_alice_player_analysis_v1.ipynb`
- `2024-07-07_bob_shapley_implementation_v2.ipynb`
- `2024-07-07_carol_research_methodology_v1.ipynb`

## Collaboration Workflow

### 1. Creating New Notebooks
1. Use appropriate template from `shared/templates/`
2. Follow naming convention
3. Add clear documentation in first cell
4. Include author, date, purpose, and team role

### 2. Sharing Notebooks
1. Place in appropriate shared directory
2. Test execution from clean state
3. Clear all outputs before committing
4. Add descriptive commit message
5. Create pull request for review

### 3. Reviewing Notebooks
1. Check code quality and documentation
2. Verify reproducibility
3. Test with different data subsets
4. Provide constructive feedback
5. Approve after addressing concerns

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Use clear variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Import modules at the top
- Use functions for repeated code

### Documentation
- Document analysis objectives
- Explain methodology and assumptions
- Interpret results and findings
- Note limitations and caveats
- Provide next steps and recommendations

### Data Security
- Never commit API keys or credentials
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Mask sensitive information in outputs
- Follow role-based access permissions

### Performance
- Clear outputs before committing
- Avoid loading large datasets unnecessarily
- Use efficient pandas operations
- Monitor memory usage
- Cache intermediate results when appropriate

## Conflict Resolution

### Version Conflicts
1. Create backup of your version
2. Pull latest changes from main branch
3. Manually merge conflicting sections
4. Test merged notebook thoroughly
5. Commit resolved version

### Collaboration Issues
1. Communicate early and often
2. Use GitHub issues for technical problems
3. Schedule team meetings for complex conflicts
4. Document decisions and rationale

## Role-Specific Guidelines

### Analysts
- Focus on data exploration and visualization
- Use read-only database connections
- Share insights through clear visualizations
- Document data quality observations

### Developers
- Implement new features and optimizations
- Test code thoroughly before sharing
- Document API changes and new functions
- Maintain backward compatibility

### Researchers
- Focus on methodology and academic rigor
- Document statistical assumptions
- Provide literature references
- Ensure reproducibility of analyses

## Resources
