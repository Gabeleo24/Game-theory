# Performance Optimization Setup Report
Generated: 2025-07-04 20:44:52

## Setup Status
✓ 3 containers running
✗ Application container not responsive
✓ Database container ready
✗ Redis container not ready

## Next Steps
1. Verify all containers are running: `docker-compose ps`
2. Check container logs: `docker-compose logs`
3. Access monitoring dashboard: http://localhost:3000 (if monitoring profile enabled)
4. Test performance optimizations with your data processing workflows

## Troubleshooting
- If containers fail to start, check Docker Desktop is running
- If memory issues occur, reduce MEMORY_LIMIT in .env file
- If performance is still slow, consider upgrading hardware
- Check logs with: `docker-compose logs [service-name]`
