## Technical Implementation

### Shapley Value Calculation

The core Shapley value implementation follows game theory principles:

```python
def calculate_shapley_contribution(player, team_coalition):
    """
    Calculate Shapley value for a player's contribution to team performance

    Args:
        player: Player object with performance metrics
        team_coalition: List of all team players

    Returns:
        float: Shapley contribution value (0-100%)
    """
    marginal_contributions = []
    for subset in all_possible_coalitions(team_coalition):
        contribution_with = team_performance(subset + [player])
        contribution_without = team_performance(subset)
        marginal_contributions.append(contribution_with - contribution_without)
    return average(marginal_contributions)
```

### Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Collection**: Automated API-Football data retrieval with rate limiting
2. **Validation**: 99.85% consistency checking and error detection

### Performance Metrics

- **Goals per 90 minutes**: Normalized scoring rate
- **Assists per 90 minutes**: Normalized assist rate
- **Average Rating**: Weighted performance rating
- **Minutes Played**: Playing time and availability
- **Shapley Contribution**: Game theory-based team contribution percentage
