    SUM(ps.goals) as total_goals
FROM player_statistics ps
JOIN competitions c ON ps.competition_id = c.competition_id
GROUP BY c.competition_id, c.competition_name
ORDER BY total_goals DESC;
```

## üìì Start with Jupyter Notebooks

### **Create Your First Analysis**
```bash
# Create notebook from template
./scripts/jupyter/manage_notebooks.sh create-notebook my_first_analysis

# This creates: /Users/home/Documents/GitHub/ADS599_Capstone/notebooks/shared/2024-07-07_yourname_my_first_analysis_v1.ipynb
```

### **Sample Notebook Code**
```python
# Standard setup for all analyses
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sqlalchemy import create_engine

# Connect to database (use your role-appropriate credentials)
engine = create_engine('postgresql://soccerapp:soccerpass123@postgres:5432/soccer_intelligence')

# Load sample data
query = """
SELECT p.player_name, t.team_name, ps.goals, ps.assists, ps.player_rating
FROM player_statistics ps
JOIN players p ON ps.player_id = p.player_id
JOIN teams t ON ps.team_id = t.team_id
WHERE ps.minutes_played > 90
ORDER BY ps.goals DESC
LIMIT 20
"""

df = pd.read_sql(query, engine)
print(f"Loaded {len(df)} player records")
display(df.head())

# Create visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.scatter(df['goals'], df['assists'], alpha=0.7)
plt.xlabel('Goals')
plt.ylabel('Assists')
plt.title('Goals vs Assists - Top Performers')
plt.show()
```

## üî¨ Advanced Analytics

### **Shapley Value Analysis**
```bash
# Run Shapley value analysis for a team
python scripts/analysis/shapley_analysis.py --team-id 50 --season 2024

# Generate team performance report
python scripts/analysis/team_performance_report.py --team-id 50
```

### **Performance Optimization**
```bash
# Check system performance
./scripts/monitoring/health_check.sh

# View performance metrics
./scripts/team/manage_team_access.sh status
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Management Commands

### **System Management**
```bash
# Check status of all services
docker-compose ps

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Restart specific service
docker-compose restart postgres

# View logs
docker-compose logs jupyter-analyst
```

### **Data Management**
```bash
# Backup database
./scripts/backup/backup_database.sh

# Load new data
python scripts/data_loading/json_to_postgres.py

# Validate data quality
./scripts/data_loading/validate_data.sh
```

## üîê Security Best Practices

### **API Key Management**
- ‚úÖ **Never commit API keys** to Git
- ‚úÖ **Use config/api_keys.yaml** for credentials
- ‚úÖ **Each team member** manages their own keys
- ‚úÖ **Pre-commit hooks** prevent accidental commits

### **Database Access**
- ‚úÖ **Role-based permissions** (analyst: read-only, developer: full access)
- ‚úÖ **Secure connections** with proper credentials
- ‚úÖ **Audit logging** for all database access
- ‚úÖ **Regular backups** with 30-day retention
