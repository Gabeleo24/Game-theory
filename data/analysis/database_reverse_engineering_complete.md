## Operation Order (Critical for Data Management)

### **INSERT ORDER (Dependencies First)**
```
1. teams (ROOT - no dependencies)
2. competitions (ROOT - no dependencies)  
3. players (STANDALONE - no dependencies)
4. matches (depends on teams + competitions)
5. player_statistics (depends on players + teams + competitions + matches)
6. team_statistics (depends on teams + competitions)
7. shapley_analysis (depends on players + teams)
8. seasons (STANDALONE)
9. collection_logs (STANDALONE)
```

### **DELETE ORDER (Reverse Dependencies)**
```
1. player_statistics (remove dependent data first)
2. team_statistics (remove dependent data)
3. shapley_analysis (remove dependent data)
4. matches (remove match records)
5. players (remove player records)
6. teams (remove root records)
7. competitions (remove root records)
8. seasons (standalone)
9. collection_logs (standalone)
```

## Table Roles and Purposes

### **ROOT TABLES (Foundation)**
- **teams**: Core team entities (67 Champions League teams)
- **competitions**: Competition definitions (1 competition loaded)

### **JUNCTION TABLES (Relationships)**
- **matches**: Game records connecting teams and competitions
- **player_statistics**: Player performance data connecting players, teams, matches
- **team_statistics**: Team performance data (ready for loading)

### **LEAF TABLES (Analysis)**
- **shapley_analysis**: Advanced player value analysis (ready for loading)

### **STANDALONE TABLES (Independent)**
- **players**: Individual player profiles (3,980 players)
- **seasons**: Season definitions (ready for loading)
- **collection_logs**: Data collection tracking (ready for logging)

## Key Insights for Database Operations

### **1. Data Loading Sequence**
```sql
-- CORRECT ORDER for loading new data:
INSERT INTO teams VALUES (...);           -- 1. Load teams first
INSERT INTO competitions VALUES (...);    -- 2. Load competitions
INSERT INTO players VALUES (...);         -- 3. Load players
INSERT INTO matches VALUES (...);         -- 4. Load matches (needs teams + competitions)
INSERT INTO player_statistics VALUES (...); -- 5. Load player stats (needs all above)
```

### **2. Data Deletion Sequence**
```sql
-- CORRECT ORDER for removing data:
DELETE FROM player_statistics WHERE ...;  -- 1. Remove dependent data first
DELETE FROM matches WHERE ...;            -- 2. Remove matches
DELETE FROM players WHERE ...;            -- 3. Remove players
DELETE FROM teams WHERE ...;              -- 4. Remove teams last
```

### **3. Query Optimization**
- **Most Connected Table**: `player_statistics` (4 foreign keys)
- **Most Referenced Table**: `teams` (4 incoming references)
- **Critical Join Path**: `teams ‚Üí player_statistics ‚Üê players`

### **4. Data Integrity Rules**
- Cannot delete teams with existing matches
- Cannot delete players with existing statistics
- Cannot delete matches with existing player statistics
- All foreign key constraints are enforced
